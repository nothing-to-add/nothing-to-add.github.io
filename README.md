## TODO - Future Enhancements

### Contact Form Implementation
Currently, the contact form has been removed for simplicity. To add a functional contact form in the future, consider these options:

1. **Formspree Integration** (Recommended)
   - Sign up at https://formspree.io (free for 50 submissions/month)
   - Create a new form and get the endpoint URL
   - Update HTML form action to point to Formspree endpoint
   - Add proper form handling JavaScript

2. **Netlify Forms**
   - If hosting on Netlify, add `netlify` attribute to form
   - Automatic form handling without external services

3. **EmailJS**
   - Client-side email sending service
   - No backend required, works with static sites

4. **Custom Backend**
   - Implement Node.js/PHP backend for form processing
   - Requires hosting with server-side capabilities

### Other Potential Enhancements
- [ ] Add actual project screenshots/demos
- [ ] Implement blog section
- [ ] Add testimonials section
- [ ] Include resume/CV download
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle
- [ ] Implement project filtering
- [ ] Add animation libraries (AOS, GSAP)
